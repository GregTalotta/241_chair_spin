# Moving a Physical Chair Corresponding to an Object in Unity
<p>The problem I am trying to solve is how to communicate to a simulator chair from a Unity game. The problem has two main aspects. The first being how to communicate to an Arduino from Unity, and the second being the design of the simulator chair. I decided to focus on the communication from Unity to Arduino. If it is made well it can be scaled and changed to work with different Arduino uses.</p>
<p> My approach to this was to first make the simplest/cheapest chair prototype I could. I made it from a cake stick, a straw, a servo, twine, and some foam board. I would have liked to use something better then twine to connect the drive shaft and the chair, but I couldnâ€™t find anything that fit. Twine, or other string, can be tied to whatever tautness I desire. I then decided to code a pure C# application to control it. I then changed the C# application to a single file that can be added to a Unity project. It has a function that takes the angle the chair should spin to, assuming a neutral point of 0 (for angle passed to it) I passed the y translation angle of the ATV object. </p>
